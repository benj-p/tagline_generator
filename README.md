## What is the Tagline Generator?

The goal of this project is to get familiarized with the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api) by using its capabilities to generate taglines for products and services. It uses the [Ruby::OpenAI gem](https://github.com/alexrudall/ruby-openai) to access the API, and more specifically its completion endpoint.
