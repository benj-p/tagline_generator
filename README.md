## What is the Tagline Generator?

The Tagline Generator is a tool that helps you generate a tagline / slogan for just about anything.

The goal of this project is to get familiarized with the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api) by using its capabilities to generate creative and relevant taglines. It uses the [Ruby::OpenAI gem](https://github.com/alexrudall/ruby-openai) to access the API, and more specifically its completion endpoint.

The live version of the app can be accessed here: https://tagline-generator.fly.dev/
